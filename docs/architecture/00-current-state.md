## Purpose

This file is the canonical short-form source of truth for Codexify's current operational and release state. If it conflicts with older architecture, planning, or roadmap language on short-horizon reality, this file wins.

## Last updated

2026-10-22

## Interpretation rule

This file is authoritative for:

- release readiness
- supported install path
- active blockers
- current priorities
- what is and is not part of the present release promise

## Current phase

`main` remains in local-first Beta hardening with a separately gated Private Preview lane. Main now includes the local history reconciliation, UMS ORM restoration, account-boundary fail-closed repair, and bounded private-preview restart evidence. No fresh integrated-tip supported-Compose qualification exists; the release gate remains `HOLD`.

## What changed recently

- Reconciled local audit history with `origin/main` through `f7e6a7f48`; no push was performed, and the stored `origin/main` is one commit ahead only because its 2026-10-22 accounting log is not present on local `main`.
- Restored the four missing UMS ORM mappings and recorded focused evidence: 124 tests passed, with one inherited stale migration-head assertion remaining; Chronicle HTTP cases were collected but not executed.
- Added fail-closed account-boundary checks for the legacy continuity operator surface outside local single-user execution, with focused route coverage.
- Recorded bounded private-preview restart, schema, health, and mount evidence; no ordinary chat, browser interaction, provider inference, or full supported-Compose run was performed.
- Merged recent Library, shell, chat/session-rail, task-cancellation, tool-loop, and accepted-turn identity changes; these remain implementation evidence, not integrated-tip release qualification.

## Current supported reality

- The named supported install path is local Docker Compose profile `v1-local-core-web-mcp` with `LLM_PROVIDER=local`, `CODEXIFY_LOCAL_ONLY_MODE=true`, and `ALLOW_CLOUD_PROVIDERS=false`.
- The Beta Supported envelope covers local inference, ordinary chat, durable threads/messages/tasks, supported document ingestion and retrieval, account ownership, migrations, and operator diagnostics; qualification is a separate gate.
- Mainline has bounded evidence at evaluated tips for topology, health, browser chat, durable readback, retrieval provenance, queue/worker lifecycle, locks, cancellation, and deadline behavior.
- `local` is the provider/policy class; `whooshd` is runtime identity; `local-chat` is the logical route; physical model display metadata is observation only.
- UMS ORM imports and migration-to-ORM parity are recorded; this does not establish complete UMS or supported-Compose qualification.
- Private Preview is opt-in: Whoosh'd remains the default local lane, DeepSeek is the only admitted cloud lane, and same-node human messaging is not default Beta support.
- The legacy continuity operator surface is fail-closed for remote, Preview, and multi-user execution because operator credentials do not establish account authority.

## Not yet true / do not assume

- Do not call the supported path release-ready; the latest complete supported-Compose qualification is `HOLD`.
- Do not infer current-tip restart/shutdown recovery, browser/event/provenance coherence, ordinary chat after restart, or a complete natural import-to-recall path.
- Do not infer exact unavailable-model rejection; the recorded complete Compose proof accepted work with model substitution and no assistant fallback flag.
- Do not treat the delegation canary as successful worker-path execution: it stopped at a `reasoning_effort` mismatch before provider execution, and worker egress was observed despite `allow_network=false`.
- Do not promote account-owned connectors, direct messaging, activation, browser host/import, Watchdog, hosted sandbox, Atlas, Pi, federation, or autonomous coding-worker work to default Beta support without current-main qualification.
- Branch-only connector work, the delegation canary, uncommitted checkout work, and local-only commits are not shipped `main` reality.
- The current-state knowledge-graph node parses but its freshness is stale; validity is not current release proof.

## Active blockers

- A fresh current-tip supported-Compose qualification is missing, including model rejection, browser/event/provenance coherence, restart recovery, and ordinary chat after restart.
- The UMS/Chronicle lane retains one inherited stale migration-head assertion, and blocked Chronicle HTTP coverage still requires execution against the corrected baseline.
- The explicit-model worker/test contradiction must be resolved with fail-closed behavior and no silent substitution.
- The delegated worker-to-adapter `reasoning_effort` contract mismatch must be resolved and re-proven before any delegation execution claim is accepted.
- The new-thread authored-message projection gap and natural import-to-recall scope proof remain open.
- Release metadata freshness and local-main publication state must be reconciled before treating them as shared release evidence.

## This week’s priorities

1. Freeze the evaluated local `main` SHA and run the complete supported-Compose proof bundle.
2. Repair the stale migration-head expectation and execute the blocked Chronicle HTTP regression cases.
3. Close the explicit-model rejection contradiction before provider execution.
4. Reprove new-thread projection, browser/event coherence, restart recovery, and ordinary chat on one evaluated tip.
5. Resolve the delegation adapter contract, complete import-to-recall scope proof, and refresh release metadata.

## Release definition right now

- [x] Supported install path, Beta boundary, provider identity, and local-only policy are defined on `main`.
- [x] Bounded chat, cancellation, durable readback, retrieval, and authorization evidence exists at evaluated mainline tips.
- [ ] A fresh current-tip Compose run passes health, inventory, chat, durable readback, retrieval, browser projection, event delivery, and restart recovery.
- [ ] An unavailable explicit model fails before provider execution and cannot be silently substituted.
- [ ] Queue/worker, deadline, graceful-stop, lock, migration, browser, import-recall, and scope-isolation gates are green on one evaluated tip.
- [ ] Delegated execution has a passing worker-to-adapter reasoning-effort contract and live proof.
- [ ] Claimed Preview or public-ingress paths have current live evidence, and changed release metadata points to the evaluated mainline.

## How to read the rest of the KB

- `system-overview.md` explains structure, not release readiness.
- `flows.md` explains runtime behavior.
- `data-and-storage.md` explains persistence/invariants.
- `config-and-ops.md` explains operator/runtime truth.
- `roadmap-signals.md` is planning guidance, not live status.
- `tech-debt-and-risks.md` is a risk register, not the active blocker list unless repeated here.
