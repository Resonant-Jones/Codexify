## Purpose

This file is the canonical short-form source of truth for Codexify’s current operational and release state. If it conflicts with older architecture, planning, or roadmap language on short-horizon reality, this file wins.

## Last updated

2026-09-04

## Interpretation rule

This file is authoritative for:

- release readiness
- supported install path
- active blockers
- current priorities
- what is and is not part of the present release promise

## Current phase

`main` remains in local-first Beta hardening with a gated private-preview lane. A bounded live private-preview schema upgrade reached repository Alembic head with data-preservation and immediate runtime-read checks passing; the installed scheduled reconciler subsequently passed from its coherent shared-image baseline without recreating healthy long-running containers or changing canonical database state. No Beta support boundary widened.

## What changed recently

- Qualified the private-preview migration lineage on a disposable clone, then upgraded the live database to `b2c8d0e3f5a7` with preservation, worker recovery, no-op, and authenticated read checks passing.
- Proved the installed post-upgrade scheduled reconciler completes against `b2c8d0e3f5a7` from its coherent shared migrator image, while preserving healthy long-running container identities and canonical database state.
- Proved chat-history disappearance is a data-present/API-filter mismatch caused by legacy Project ownership divergence; no canonical chat row loss or runtime database-target drift was found.
- Accepted ADR-081 naming `projects.user_id` as Project ownership authority; runtime normalization and legacy reconciliation remain unfinished.
- Merged phone sidebar/navigation and composer overflow work with focused frontend coverage; this is UI change evidence, not supported-path browser proof.
- Added a metering/billing foundation design sketch; it is explicitly unimplemented and does not affect release scope.

## Current supported reality

- The named supported install path is local Docker Compose using `v1-local-core-web-mcp` with `LLM_PROVIDER=local`, `CODEXIFY_LOCAL_ONLY_MODE=true`, and `ALLOW_CLOUD_PROVIDERS=false`.
- The intended Beta Supported boundary remains local inference, ordinary chat, durable threads/messages/tasks, upload → embed → readback, workspace-local retrieval, identity/ownership, migrations, and operator diagnostics; this is support doctrine, not current-tip qualification.
- Mainline contains focused project lifecycle, conversation-origin, document-artifact preview, Guardian Chat, account-import, and mobile-shell repairs with targeted coverage; supported-path and authenticated browser proof remain separate gates.
- Valid account-import multipart batches are accepted and durably staged on the server path; the Safari/WebKit envelope failure remains unrepaired.
- Private-preview live migration preservation/readback, Guardian secret rotation, Cloudflare ingress, and private-profile People/Share behavior have bounded evidence; these do not admit guests or widen Beta.
- Pi 0.82.1 wrapper/API, source-vendor, identity, framing, and telemetry changes remain internal, non-inference, or OAuth-readiness qualification.

## Not yet true / do not assume

- Do not assume current-tip Compose health, model inventory, terminal chat, durable assistant readback, retrieval, queue/worker execution, locks, terminal events, or recovery closure.
- Do not treat the private-preview migration and scheduled-recovery proof as a canary or provider/persistence closure: the database and reconciler are coherent at `b2c8d0e3f5a7`, while the remaining preview gates stay open.
- Do not treat ADR-081 acceptance, chat-history classification, or focused UI tests as runtime Project-ownership convergence or supported browser proof.
- Do not treat CE-L1 OAuth readiness, Pi telemetry, wrapper tests, or source-vendor closure as live provider/model execution, coding-loop completion, persisted-result readback, or Beta proof.
- Do not treat private-preview configuration, bounded recovery/ingress receipts, or a live health/read result as an admitted canary; tester isolation, provider, persistence, and observability gates remain open.
- Do not treat Modal or E2B partial conformance as a qualified hosted sandbox, provider-enforced storage/read-only boundary, supported runtime path, or release support.
- Do not infer shipped reality from mutable `latest`, another checkout, local-only artifacts, planning language, or docs alone; realtime delivery, attachments, federation, and cross-node People messaging remain deferred.

## Active blockers

- Fresh supported-Compose closure is missing at the current `main` tip, including health, chat, persistence/readback, retrieval, queue/worker, locks, and terminal events.
- Private-preview provider-specific execution, persistence, observability, tester isolation, and approved non-admin canary gates remain open; the bounded scheduled-recovery gate is now proven.
- Fresh-state Chroma startup/retrieval qualification remains unresolved; Chroma is derived state and no repair or historical restore is proven.
- CE-L1 still lacks live provider/model execution, terminal durable result, and source-thread readback.
- The friends-and-family canary is blocked on approved non-admin testers plus reruns of Access, isolation, provider, persistence, and bounded-observability gates; DeepSeek rotation/requalification remains open.
- Project-ownership runtime/data convergence, Safari multipart-envelope repair, Watchdog policy/model, immutable image-retention, hosted-sandbox, and recent supported-path browser gates remain unclosed.

## This week’s priorities

1. Rerun current-main supported-Compose closure with the canonical local profile.
2. Prove health, terminal chat, persistence/readback, retrieval, queue/worker, locks, and terminal events on that profile; requalify Chroma.
3. Requalify CE-L1 live execution/readback and rotate/requalify the private-preview DeepSeek credential before tester execution.
4. Close Project-ownership convergence, Safari upload-envelope regression, and the browser, Watchdog, retention, and hosted-sandbox gates.

## Release definition right now

- [x] Supported local Compose path, local-only defaults, and Beta boundary are defined on `main`.
- [x] Internal, bounded/conditional, qualification-pending, and Out-of-Beta surfaces remain separate from Beta Supported claims.
- [x] Private-preview migration preservation/readback and ingress proofs are bounded without guest admission or release widening.
- [ ] Current-tip Compose proves healthy startup, model inventory, terminal chat, persistence/readback, and retrieval.
- [ ] Queue, worker, lock, migration, configuration, recovery, browser, and account-import claimed-path evidence gates are green.
- [ ] Every claimed preview/provider lane has current-main proof for live execution, durable readback, isolation, and scheduled recovery where applicable.

## How to read the rest of the KB

- `system-overview.md` explains structure, not release readiness.
- `flows.md` explains runtime behavior.
- `data-and-storage.md` explains persistence/invariants.
- `config-and-ops.md` explains operator/runtime truth.
- `roadmap-signals.md` is planning guidance, not live status.
- `tech-debt-and-risks.md` is a risk register, not the active blocker list unless repeated here.

## Release classes

The five release classes below are accepted architecture per ADR-069. They are
human-facing release interpretations over the existing Product Architecture
Assertion dimensions and the `00-current-state.md` short-form authority, not
new schema enums. Evidence maturity and support posture remain orthogonal
under ADR-069. Support doctrine does not prove every current-tip gate is
green; the "Not yet true / do not assume" and "Active blockers" sections above
remain authoritative for the present live-state truth.

### Beta Supported

The current Beta Supported envelope is the local-first supported install
path and its core surfaces, already present in this document and accepted
by ADR-069:

- Local Docker Compose runtime, with the local-only default provider posture
  (`CODEXIFY_LOCAL_ONLY_MODE=true`, `ALLOW_CLOUD_PROVIDERS=false`,
  `LLM_PROVIDER=local`).
- Local inference (Whoosh'd) and the supported local profile.
- Core startup / migration lifecycle.
- Queue-backed chat completion lifecycle.
- Durable thread / message / task persistence.
- Supported health and runtime diagnostics.
- Ordinary chat, threads, durable conversation history, projects, and
  project / thread / workspace navigation.
- Documents and media ingestion on currently implemented supported formats.
- Embedding and workspace-scoped retrieval.
- Codexify-native identity / authentication boundaries and account-scoped
  ownership behavior.
- Operator-visible health and configuration truth required to run the
  self-hosted node.

This is support doctrine, not current-tip qualification. The "Not yet true
/ do not assume" section above continues to bound what is provably green
on the current `main` tip. Implementation presence in a code path does not
promote a capability to Beta Supported; only the architecture-accepted
support envelope under ADR-069 does.

### Beta Bounded / Conditional

Surfaces intentionally inside the Beta envelope but only under an explicit
authority, topology, provider, mode, or capability boundary. The
classification below is the current accepted one; no new bounded surface
is added by this section.

- Persona Studio: profile creation / editing, persistence, selection, and
  application of supported persona / profile configuration to ordinary chat.
  TTS / voice execution, unsupported permission authoring, unsupported
  retrieval-policy execution, and "preview UI equals enforcement" claims
  are excluded from this promotion.
- Import / continuity entry surfaces: OpenAI / ChatGPT export import, Task
  Prompt Archive, owner-scoped retry / recovery behavior already
  implemented, and account export / restore to the exact extent supported
  by the existing contract and implementation. Not every historical
  corpus, provider export format, or migration shape is claimed.
- Repository intelligence on the supported local single-user path:
  repository candidate discovery, explicit repository import,
  account / Project `RepositoryBinding`, direct Project-bound repository
  search, and ordinary-chat repository search exposure only when
  Guardian resolves exactly one valid active binding and existing
  authority checks pass. Remote / multi-user / Hosted-Room repository
  authority remains outside this bounded Beta claim.
- Bounded Guardian tool execution: read-only health capability, and
  bounded Project repository search where current eligibility /
  authority checks pass. Advertised-subset authority, Guardian-owned
  execution authority, exact capability eligibility, bounded command
  count, and provider capability checks are preserved. Arbitrary tools,
  arbitrary write operations, and generic shell / filesystem execution
  are not promoted.
- MCP / extensibility: the public MCP extension posture may be described as
  part of Beta only as a bounded extension interface. A general plugin
  marketplace, plugin SDK internals as public Beta API, and arbitrary
  plugin execution bypassing Guardian policy are not claimed.
- Desktop / Tauri client (if current `main` still contains the functioning
  local desktop / Tauri presentation layer): Beta Bounded / Conditional
  when used as a client of the same supported local Guardian node. Not a
  packaged production desktop distribution, not auto-update support, not
  an independent desktop persistence / runtime authority, not a separate
  release topology not currently proven.

### Internal

The following remain explicitly internal, not user-facing release promises:

- direct Command Bus HTTP / control-plane API
- plugin SDK internals
- generic tools / API tools surfaces currently marked internal or
  quarantined
- developer-only diagnostics
- unsafe operator mutation surfaces
- implementation / control-plane mechanisms that support Beta behavior
  without being user-facing promises
- Pi 0.82.1 wrapper/API, source-vendor, identity, framing, and telemetry
  surfaces (per the "Current supported reality" / "Not yet true" sections
  above; non-inference / OAuth-readiness qualification; not a
  user-facing release promise at the current `main` tip).
- CE-L1 wiring (lives in code paths and is required to close active
  blockers, but remains internal / qualification pending — see below).
- Campaign / coding-worker substrate (operational substrate that supports
  Beta behavior; not a user-facing release promise).

Implementation presence of Pi, CE-L1, or coding-worker wiring does not
promote those surfaces to Beta Supported merely because their code paths
exist.

### Qualification Pending

Intended or plausible Beta surface with implementation present, but a
specifically named proof / authority / operational gate remains open.
Each entry below names its explicit `remaining gate` rather than only
saying "not supported," per the ADR-069 Qualification-Pending Doctrine.

- **Coding Loop** — `remaining gate` requires: live provider/model
  execution, terminal durable result, and source-thread readback on the
  claimed supported profile. CE-L1 wiring remains internal / qualification
  pending; no `LIVE_EXECUTOR_PROVEN_CANONICAL` is emitted by this section.
- **Hosted Rooms** — `remaining gate` requires: clean supported / tester
  startup and owner / guest live semantic proof after migration repair.
- **DeepSeek / private-preview provider lane** — `remaining gate` requires
  required credentials, authenticated provider-specific persisted runtime
  proof, and explicit supported-profile promotion.
- **Browser side-panel / Browser Host release surface** — `remaining gate`
  follows whichever current host / auth / release proof remains open on the
  current `main` tip after the present private-preview gates.
- **Any desktop packaging behavior not covered by the bounded local-client
  claim** in the Beta Bounded / Conditional section above.

### Out of Beta

The following are explicitly excluded from the present Beta promise under
ADR-069 and are not classified as qualification-pending; they are
intentionally out of scope:

- TTS / voice — Out of Beta
- federation — Out of Beta
- unrestricted autonomous / recursive agent execution
- arbitrary write-capability tool use
- generic shell / filesystem execution through ordinary Beta chat
- public Command Bus exposure
- generic cron / unattended automation
- generic connectors without separate qualification
- graph-write / Neo4j-derived-write behavior where the supported path
  remains flagged off or quarantined
- remote / multi-user repository execution not covered by a separately
  accepted authority contract and live proof
